## Hotel Management system

The Hotel Management System aims to provide a customer view of the hotel. It is a simple reservation system that  helps the customers to reserve rooms, view the booking and cancel the bookings. 
The development of the system contains the following activities, which try to automate the entire process of reserving rooms, reviewing the booking and cancellation of rooms. The key features of the project are as follows:

1.The user has to create a user name and password to login the system. The user credentials will be maintained in a file by the system.
2.The user can  book a room. The system will check if room the customer want to reserve is available. If a room is available, then a room number will be alloted to the user.
3.The user can  book more than one room the and view the reservations which will the show the the name of the customer, room allocated, and status of booking.
4.The user can also cancel the booking using the room number. The system will check for the room number in the database and will deallocate it.
